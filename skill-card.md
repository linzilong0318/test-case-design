## Use Case: <br>
Developers, QA engineers, and product teams use this Chinese-language skill to produce structured Markdown test cases for functional testing, API testing, AI Agent testing, and platform-specific scenarios. It is intended for test-case design only, not test strategy, penetration testing, load testing, or automation script generation. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Generated or example test cases may include sample usernames, passwords, bearer tokens, or API keys. <br>
Mitigation: Replace sample credentials and tokens with placeholders before sharing or storing generated test cases. <br>
Risk: Requests mentioning Agent may trigger this skill even when the user only intended a general agent discussion. <br>
Mitigation: Use the skill for explicit test-case design tasks and review Agent-related outputs for relevance before relying on them. <br>
Risk: The skill is focused on test-case writing and does not create test plans, security scans, load tests, or automation scripts. <br>
Mitigation: Use separate planning, security, performance, or automation workflows for those activities. <br>
